## Hey there 👋

I’m **Xitiz**, a frontend web developer based in **Nepal**.  
I build **clean, minimal, and mobile-responsive web interfaces** with a strong focus on **usability and performance**.

This is a fresh profile. I haven’t published public repositories yet, but I’m actively building projects and will be releasing them here in the near future — **all built from scratch**.

---

### 🛠 Tools & Tech

- React
- JavaScript (Vanilla, ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS
- Pure CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive & mobile-first design

---

### 💡 Principles I work by

- Clean UI & minimal design **>** flashy UI  
- Shipping small, complete projects **>** hoarding tutorials  
- Fundamentals **before** frameworks  

---

### 📌 Notes

I focus on writing **understandable, maintainable frontend code** and turning designs into functional, real-world interfaces.
