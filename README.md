## Hi there 👋
I'm Xitiz, a frontend web-devloper based in Nepal.
I build **clean, minimal, and mobile-responsive web interfaces** with a strong focus on usability and performance.
I haven't post a public reposotory yet in this account but in near future i am going too publish all my build.


My main tech stacks are react, pure vanila javascript tailwind and pure css. 

Fun fact about me:
- Clean UI and minimal design > flashy UI
- Shipping small projects > hoarding tutorials
